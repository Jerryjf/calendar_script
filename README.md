#calendar_script
-
This Google Apps Script was made to help automate the monthly content calendars my team produces for our clients' social media. Each month, we update the dates, delete old content, add new content, color coordinate cells, and download a hard-copy to be sent to the client.

This script helps automate this - by adding a custom menu item called "NEW MONTH" in the top ribbon, this script will run the separate functions for each task.
